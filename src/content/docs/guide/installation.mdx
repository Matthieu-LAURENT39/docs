import {Tabs, TabItem, LinkCard} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Let's get started! First up, you will want to install Atuin. We have an install
script which handles most of the commonly used platforms and package managers:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="bash/zsh">
  ```bash
  bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://setup.atuin.sh)
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="fish">
  ```bash
  bash (curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://setup.atuin.sh | psub)
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Manual install

If you don't wish to use the installer, the manual steps are as follows. Please
note that it's not enough to install the binary, there is also a shell plugin
that requires settings up.

#### cargo

It's best to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to get setup with a Rust
toolchain, then you can run:

```
cargo install atuin
```
  
And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin)

#### Homebrew

```
brew install atuin
```
  
And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin)
  
#### MacPorts

Atuin is also available in [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/atuin/)  
  
```
sudo port install atuin
```
  
And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin)

#### Nix

This repository is a flake, and can be installed using `nix profile`:

```
nix profile install "github:atuinsh/atuin"
```

Atuin is also available in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs):

```
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA atuin
```

And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin)
#### Pacman

Atuin is available in the Arch Linux [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/atuin/):

```
pacman -S atuin
```
  
And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin)

#### Xbps

Atuin is available in the Void Linux [repository](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/tree/master/srcpkgs/atuin):

```
sudo xbps-install atuin
```

And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin)

#### Termux

Atuin is available in the Termux package repository:

```
pkg install atuin
```
  
And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin)

#### From source

Note: Atuin builds on the latest stable version of Rust, and we make no
promises regarding older versions. We recommend using rustup.

```
git clone https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin.git
cd atuin/atuin
cargo install --path .
```

## Shell plugin

Once the binary is installed, the shell plugin requires installing. If you use
the install script, this should all be done for you! After installing, remember to restart your shell.

#### zsh

```
echo 'eval "$(atuin init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

##### Zinit

```sh
zinit load atuinsh/atuin
```

##### Antigen  
  
```sh  
antigen bundle atuinsh/atuin@main
```

#### bash

##### [ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh)

Atuin works best in bash when using [ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh).

With ble.sh installed, just add atuin to your .bashrc

```bash
echo 'eval "$(atuin init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

##### [bash-preexec](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec)

[Bash-preexec](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec) can also be used, but you may experience some minor problems with the recorded duration and exit status of some commands.

To use bash-preexec, download and initialize it

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec/master/bash-preexec.sh -o ~/.bash-preexec.sh
echo '[[ -f ~/.bash-preexec.sh ]] && source ~/.bash-preexec.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Then setup Atuin

```bash
echo 'eval "$(atuin init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

**PLEASE NOTE**

bash-preexec currently has an issue where it will stop honoring `ignorespace`. While Atuin will ignore commands prefixed with whitespace, they may still end up in your bash history. Please check your configuration! All other shells do not have this issue.

#### fish

Add

```
atuin init fish | source
```

to your `is-interactive` block in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file
  
#### Nushell

Run in *Nushell*:

```
mkdir ~/.local/share/atuin/
atuin init nu | save ~/.local/share/atuin/init.nu
```

Add to `config.nu`:

```
source ~/.local/share/atuin/init.nu
```

#### xonsh

Add
```
execx($(atuin init xonsh))
```
to the end of your `~/.xonshrc`
